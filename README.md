Electronic Project for 252
Work FLow:
  1. Node devices => set in each corridor contains => flame sensor*1
                                                   => gas sensor*1
                                                   => dht22 sensor*1
                                                   => sonar sensor*1
                                                   => power supply unit => battery case*1
                                                                        => 3.7v battery*1
                                                                        => 7085 IC*1


Thresholds:
-----------------------------------------
#flame => normal : greater than 900 less than 1000
       => high flame : below 750
      => no flame : greater than 1001
#temp => normal : 28-30
      => greater than 32
#humidity => 
#gas => normal : greater than 500 less than 700
     => high risk : greater than 800 less than 900
